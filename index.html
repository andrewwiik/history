        <p>James Madison is known as the Father of the Constitution, and for good reason, not only did he draft the Bill of Rights but he also believed that the Constitution shouldn't be exploited for any reason. It was this precident that he failed to set
          that could of saved the United States from the problems it has today. He was quoted saying:</p>
        <blockquote>"Liberty may be endangered by the abuse of liberty, but also by the abuse of power."
        </blockquote>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>He was elected to the newly formed U.S. House of Representatives, where he served from 1789 to 1797.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4><i>The War of 1812</i></h4>
        <p>He signed Macon’s Bill Number Two into law in 1810. This law essentially set the stage for the War of 1812. Due to increasing disregard for U.S. neutrality in the French-British conflict and a call for military action from new members of Congress.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5><i>continued...</i></h5>
        <p>The War of 1812 was peculiar in that the United States was not under attack, or even the threat of attack. Many, therefore, have argued that the war was avoidable. American commerce, however, was being restricted by the Napoleonic Wars between
          France and Great Britain. Furthermore, Britain was seizing American ships, kidnapping (“impressing” as it was called) sailors, and stirring Indians in the Northwest to launch raids on American soil.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4 style="text-decoration:underline;">Is it possible for a president to run a war effectively and obey the Constitution at the same time?</h4>
        <p>Lincoln and Roosevelt, as war presidents, centralized power, restricted liberty, and suspended key parts of the Constitution during their terms in office, as which is the general practice today. James Madison however, the first war president in
          U.S. history, did not set such a precident, He argued that war emergencies, were tests to obey the Constitution, not ignore it. His conduct in the War of 1812 illumintes this belief.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4><i>Continued...</i></h4>
        <p>James Madison outlined this belief when when he said: </p>
        <blockquote>"War should only be declared by the authority of the people, whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens, instead of the government which is to reap its fruits"</blockquote>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Washington is Burned (August 24, 1814)</h4>
        <p>A British force led by Major General Robert Ross occupied Washington City and set to the White House and other Public Buidlings. The reconstruction started during Madison's Presidency but he never got to reside in the new Capitol.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        James Madison introduced the Virginia Plan. A plan which laid the foundation for the goverment. It introduced a system of Checks and Balances to prevent the goverment from turning into a monarchy, James Madison is quoted saying:
        <blockquote>"The truth is that all men having power ought to be mistrusted."</blockquote>
